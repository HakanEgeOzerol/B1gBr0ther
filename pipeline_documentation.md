# B1gBr0ther CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document outlines the CI/CD pipeline configuration for the B1gBr0ther Android application.

## Pipeline Overview

The B1gBr0ther CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: Compiles the application code
2. **Test**: Runs unit tests
3. **Lint**: Performs static code analysis
4. **Deploy**: Prepares the application for deployment (when applicable)

## Build Configuration

The build process uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL. The main configuration files are:

- `build.gradle.kts` (root project)
- `app/build.gradle.kts` (application module)
- `libs.versions.toml` (dependency versions)

## Unit Testing

The application includes unit tests for key components:

### Test Coverage

- **DashboardActivity**: Covers gestures, audio, task tracking, and UI integration
- **ExportPage**: Tests export logic, filters, and file formats
- **DatabaseManager & AppDatabase**: Tests core data operations

### Running Tests

To run all unit tests:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

To run specific test classes:

```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.b1gbr0ther.DashboardActivityTest"
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.b1gbr0ther.ExportPageTest"
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.b1gbr0ther.data.database.DatabaseManagerTest"
```

## Android Lint

Android Lint is configured to perform static code analysis and identify potential issues in the codebase.

### Lint Configuration

The lint configuration is defined in:
- `app/lint.xml`: Custom lint rules
- `app/build.gradle.kts`: Lint execution options

### Lint Rules

The following lint checks are configured:

- **Security**: Exported components, JavaScript security, secure random
- **Performance**: Layout optimization, efficient resource usage
- **UI**: Content descriptions, hardcoded text
- **Resources**: Unused resources, missing translations

### Running Lint

To run lint checks:

```bash
./gradlew lint
```

Lint reports are generated in:
- HTML: `app/build/reports/lint-results.html`
- XML: `app/build/reports/lint-results.xml`

## CI/CD Integration

To integrate this pipeline with a CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI):

1. Set up a workflow that runs on push/pull request
2. Configure the build environment with JDK 11 and Android SDK
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew test
./gradlew lint
```

4. Archive test and lint reports as artifacts
5. Configure failure conditions based on test results and lint errors

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for the pipeline:

1. Add instrumented tests for UI components
2. Implement code coverage reporting
3. Add automated deployment to app distribution platforms
4. Integrate with code quality tools like SonarQube
